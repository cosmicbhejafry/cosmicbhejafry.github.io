<h1>Volunteering</h1>
<p>I strongly believe in doing my best to contribute to causes which seek to make the world a more sustainable, and more inclusive place.  I&rsquo;m currently volunteering for</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/indradhanu_iitd/" target="_blank">Indradhanu</a>

, the queer collective of IIT Delhi
<ul>
<li>My favourite event that I helped organize was &ldquo;<em>spread</em> the love&rdquo;- a community art event inspired by the AIDS memorial quilt. One of the most gratifying pieces of code I&rsquo;ve ever written was the canvas-allotment code for this event. To know more about it click <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MVtMpsHGITpm9nsJcmcUdW67NgcFL4a2ayJLyoBRYZ4/edit#heading=h.kk1966kbedef4" target="_blank">here</a>

 and feel free to contact me if you&rsquo;d like to look at the code! I&rsquo;ll make it open source as soon as I have some energy to polish and release it.</li>
<li>I was also a part of the organizing committee for IIT-D&rsquo;s first pride week and pride march, currently a member- involved in outreach and sensitization</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve volunteered at</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The SheCodes programme run by the Delhi government, to teach coding to underprivileged female students enrolled in government schools and motivate them to take up careers in STEM.</p>
<ul>
<li>I got to interact with aaround 40 kids on a weekly basis, and I taught them the basics of animation and coding. In the middle of my tenure, COVID struck and everything became online. Most of these kids only had access to desktop computers via their school, which was shut now. Ensuring that they could learn the fundamentals of coding (which we were going to teach using Scratch) in such a scenario was tricky, so we decided to integrate an app called FlipAClip in the curriculum and taught them &ldquo;how to animate&rdquo; first. It was challenging, to say the least- but also extremely gratifying.</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>GreenWarriors, NSS IIT Delhi- which aims to make the campus a more sustainable and eco-friendly place; was involved in a project related to waste segregation on campus.</p>
<ul>
<li>This was done in collaboration with <a href="https://www.chintan-india.org/" target="_blank">Chintan</a>

 an NGO dedicated to environmental research and action, as a step towards eradicating the mini-landfill on campus behind the LHC.</li>
<li>We went door-to-door all around the IIT Delhi campus, collecting data about resident&rsquo;s waste segregation habits, and imparting knowledge and awareness related to waste segregation. I interviewed people for ~3-4 hours every week for 8 weeks in 2018.</li>
<li>During this time, I made a personal resolve to minimize my personal usage of plastic (although I do agree that environmental damage is a systemic problem but doing that anyway helped me sleep a little better at night) and became a &ldquo;carry your own cup for coffee and drinks&rdquo; evangelist.</li>
