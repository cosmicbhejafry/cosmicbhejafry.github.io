<h1>research</h1>
<p>I am interested in modelling biological systems using mathematics, machine learning theory, algorithmic information theory, and more broadly- statistics and theoretical computer science. I&rsquo;m interested in exploring human computer interaction; using technology in artistic ways (&amp; its implications thereof); and also in exploring research on the interpretability of AI systems, and questions surrounding sustainability of AI systems, and inclusivity in AI in more depth.</p>

<p><strong>Examining forms of inductive bias to enhance evolvability of Boolean functions</strong> (with <a href="https://web.iitd.ac.in/~sumeet/research.html" target="_blank">Prof. Sumeet Agarwal</a>

, IIT Delhi)</p>
<p>Recent work has sought to look at the evolvability of biological networks by representing them as graphs or functions, and studying the conditions under which certain kinds of outcomes are feasibly achievable. One key factor in enabling evolvability appears to be some form of prior constraint or <em>inductive bias</em> on the evolutionary landscape, which typically represents an implicit bias towards structures with low-complexity. We understand, and try to relate two different approaches for incorporating this kind of inductive bias in genetic algorithms. <em>The goal of our work is to propose models which allow us to approximate, compare and unify learning-theoretic and information-theoretic models of evolution.</em></p>
<p>Recent updates: Our short-paper &ldquo;Examining Forms of Inductive Bias Towards `Simplicity' in Genetic Algorithms to Enhance Evolvability of Boolean Functions&rdquo; was accepted at <a href="https://gecco-2021.sigevo.org/HomePage" target="_blank">GECCO 2021</a>

, and I recieved an <a href="https://women.acm.org/scholars/acm-w-scholars/hetvi-jethwani/" target="_blank">ACM-W scholarship</a>

 to attend the same.</p>
<p>The paper can be accessed <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3449726.3459429" target="_blank">here</a>

, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoCXFkn-k2k" target="_blank">here</a>

 is a 5-min summary of the same.</p>

<p><strong>Summarizing Hierarchical Multidimensional data</strong> (with Prof. Laks Lakshmanan, UBC Vancouver and Dr. Divesh Srivastrava, AT&amp;T Labs)</p>
<p><em>As part of the <a href="https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/globalink/globalink-research-internship" target="_blank">MITACS Globalink Research Internship</a>

</em></p>
<p>The goal of our work is to develop a principled framework and efficient algorithms for generating optimal lossless and lossy multidimensional hierarchical summaries of ML model predictions. This is an extension of the work done by Alexandra Kim <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9101557" target="_blank">here,</a>

 and we extend that algorithm to histograms by formulating the problem as a linear optimization problem. We also aim to explore several interesting variations in a theoretically rigorous way.</p>
<p>Coming soon: a demo of the algorithm, and a pdf with more technical details.</p>

<p><strong>Hierarchical, bandit-based Algorithms for discrete convex optimization</strong> (with <a href="https://simonshaoleidu.com/" target="_blank">Prof. Simon Shaolei Du</a>

, University of Washington)</p>
<p>The goal of our work is to analyze and give regret and query-complexity bounds for algorithms for black-box optimization over discrete domains, more specifically- we&rsquo;re trying to analyse the <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/LaMCTS" target="_blank">La-MCTS</a>

 algorithm proposed by Wang et al. The approaches we are trying to build upon include looking at a hierarchical bandit algorithm framework of the sort used to analyse Monte Carlo Tree Search, and literature from discrete convex analysis.</p>

<p><strong>Getting Situated with Augmented Reality</strong> (at COCOON &lsquo;21, School For Poetic Computation)</p>
<p>Throughout the 5 week session, we ruminated upon the ethics, politics and technology of augmented reality; and explored creating focused on augmenting the face, a specific space, a specific target (like an image), and sound. All my assignments, and resources used for the course can be found <a href="https://github.com/cosmicbhejafry/AR-expts-sfpc" target="_blank">here.</a>

<p><strong>Representing a poem as a finite state machine (personal project)</strong></p>
<p>I try to examine the flow of poetry by representing a poem like a state machine, where the transitions are &lsquo;breaks&rsquo; - the end of a word, line, or stanza; and the states are words. My primary motivation for doing this came from the thought of constructing a &lsquo;performance&rsquo; tool to give the reader the agency to deconstruct texts. More on this <a href="https://github.com/cosmicbhejafry/poem-to-FSM" target="_blank">here</a>
