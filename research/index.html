<meta name="twitter:description" content="Examining forms of inductive bias to enhance evolvability of Boolean functions (with Prof. Sumeet Agarwal, IIT Delhi)
Recent work has sought to look at the evolvability of biological networks by representing them as graphs or functions, and studying the conditions under which certain kinds of outcomes are feasibly achievable. One key factor in enabling evolvability appears to be some form of prior constraint or inductive bias on the evolutionary landscape, which typically represents an implicit bias towards structures with low-complexity."/>

<p><strong>Examining forms of inductive bias to enhance evolvability of Boolean functions</strong> (with <a href="https://web.iitd.ac.in/~sumeet/research.html" target="_blank">Prof. Sumeet Agarwal</a>

, IIT Delhi)</p>
<p>Recent work has sought to look at the evolvability of biological networks by representing them as graphs or functions, and studying the conditions under which certain kinds of outcomes are feasibly achievable. One key factor in enabling evolvability appears to be some form of prior constraint or <em>inductive bias</em> on the evolutionary landscape, which typically represents an implicit bias towards structures with low-complexity. We understand, and try to relate two different approaches for incorporating this kind of inductive bias in genetic algorithms. <em>The goal of our work is to propose models which allow us to approximate, compare and unify learning-theoretic and information-theoretic models of evolution.</em></p>
<p>Recent updates: Our poster &ldquo;Examining Forms of Inductive Bias Towards `Simplicity' in Genetic Algorithms to Enhance Evolvability of Boolean Functions&rdquo; was accepted at <a href="https://gecco-2021.sigevo.org/HomePage" target="_blank">GECCO 2021</a>

, and I have recieved an ACM-W scholarship sponsored by Google to attend the same.</p>
